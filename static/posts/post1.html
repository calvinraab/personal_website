        <h2>How Neural Networks Work</h2>
        <p>Neural networks consist of input layers, hidden layers, and output layers. These networks are trained using large datasets to make predictions or classifications.</p>

        <h2>Applications of Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>Neural networks are widely used in image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. They are especially effective in handling complex, non-linear relationships in data.</p>

        <p>Some common types of neural networks include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feedforward Neural Networks</li>
            <li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</li>
            <li>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding the fundamentals of neural networks is crucial for leveraging their power in modern machine learning tasks. With the growing data available today, neural networks will continue to play a significant role in various AI applications.</p>
